# 2025-EasyMatch
### üìñ Introduction
EasyMatch is a website that helps you **organize** padel, tennis, beach volleyball, or 7v7 football **matches** ‚Äî either with friends (**private**) or with strangers (**public**) at a similar skill level. It also includes a live chat feature to communicate with other players or to get help from clubs or the site‚Äôs administrators. <br/><br/>

  <br/><br/>

In this document, **only** the functional and technical objectives of the EasyMatch application have been defined. Development has been initiated, but the implementation is not yet functional.

## Objectives

### ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Objectives
The web page aims to **make organizing sports matches easier** by providing a centralized platform where players can search for, create, and join games at partnered clubs. It also seeks to improve communication between players and clubs through an integrated chat system.

1. The system should allow users to **create public matches** (open to anyone) or **private** matches (for friends only), specifying the sport, date, and time.  
2. The system should allow users to **search for and join public matches** at partnered clubs filtering by sport, skill level, date, city...  
3. The system should allow users to **leave those matches** before they are closed, meaning before all spots have been filled.  
4. The system should allow users to **view and/or edit their basic information** (profile picture, username, match history, skill-level graph, etc.). Likewise, the system should allow them to delete their account.  
5. The system should allow users to **add the result of a completed match**, which must then be validated by both pairs of players.  
6. The system should include a **real-time communication channel** that allows players to chat with each other, as well as with club staff and site administrators, to resolve questions or issues.  

---

### üíª Technical Objectives
The website will be implemented using technologies that are well-established both academically and professionally, like **Spring Boot** for the backend, **Angular** for the frontend, and **MySQL** as the database management system. Additionally, software quality will be ensured through continuous integration and deployment using **GitHub Actions**, along with a set of automated tests that guarantee the reliability of the core functionalities.

1. The system should follow a **SPA (Single Page Application)** architecture, using the **Angular** framework for frontend development.  
2. The system should provide a backend based on **Java** with **Spring Boot**, implementing a **REST API** to handle business logic.  
3. The system should have a **continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline, set up with **GitHub Actions** to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.  
4. The system should use a **MySQL relational database** to store structured information (entities).  
5. The system should have a **GitHub repository** for version control and software lifecycle management.  
6. The system should include **unitary tests** developed with **JUnit and Mockito** to ensure the correctness of the backend logic.  
7. The system should implement **integration tests** using **Rest Assured** to validate communication with the REST API.  
8. The system should carry out **end-to-end tests** with **Selenium** to verify the proper functioning of the frontend from the user's perspective.  
9. The system must be packaged in **Docker** containers to ensure portability, facilitate deployment, and guarantee consistency across development, testing, and production environments.  
10. The system should implement **real-time communication via WebSockets** to enable the chat feature.


## Methodology
The development of the website will be carried out following an **incremental** and **iterative** approach, which allows the system to be built in **successive phases**, delivering functional versions at the end of each one. 

### üóÇ Phases:

- <ins>**Phase 1 (1<sup>st</sup> to September 15<sup>th</sup>)**</ins> : **Definition of functionalities** 
  In this phase, the functional and technical objectives of the website have been gathered and documented. The general functionality description is located in the _**Objectives**_ section specifically in the _**Functional objectives**_ subsection. In contrast, the detailed description of each functionality and its intended audience can be found in the _**Detailed functionalities**_ section.

- <ins>**Phase 2 (September 15<sup>th</sup> to October 15<sup>th</sup>)**</ins> : **Configuration of technologies and development tools with quality controls that are carried out periodically** 

- <ins>**Phases 3, 4 & 5 (October 15<sup>th</sup> to April 15<sup>th</sup>)**</ins>: **Iterative and incremental development of the application. At the end of each phase, a new release will be published** 

- <ins>**Phase 6 (April 15<sup>th</sup> to May 15<sup>th</sup>)**</ins>: **Writing the final report** 

- <ins>**Phase 7 (May 15<sup>th</sup> to June <sup>th</sup>)**</ins>: **Preparation of the presentation**
